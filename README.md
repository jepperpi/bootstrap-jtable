![A screenshot of jTable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jepperpi/jtable/master/screenshot.png)

I have added some [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) style to [jTable](https://github.com/hikalkan/jtable) jquery plugin.

I' ve not create a jtable theme, I have change jtable code in order to include bootsrap css class in the elements of table.

It's been created for a personal project: it's not been heavy tested.

Usage
